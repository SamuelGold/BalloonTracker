1800mAh 3S Li-Poly battery was used to power Air station. An additional 1850 Samsung battery was used to power an action camera to ensure its long working time. Because of the low temperature at the high altitudes, Thermopaxx chemical warmers were used to heat the batteries. A foam container with a wall thickness of 2.5 cm was used as an enclosure.
The total weight of the payload was about 650g.
